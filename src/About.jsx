      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
      I am Parashuram Talawar, and I am currently serving as the Head of the Computer Science Department at a government college in Karnataka. With over 20 years of academic and research experience, I have been passionately dedicated to teaching, mentoring students, and making significant contributions to the field of computer science. My research has focused on areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science, and I have actively sought to integrate cutting-edge technologies into the curriculum to ensure that our students are well-prepared for the ever-evolving demands of the industry. Additionally, I have collaborated with industry partners to provide opportunities for hands-on learning and practical experience for our students, further enriching their educational journey.
